Here’s the clean, focused Option 2 section for your README that explains exactly how to run the machine-independent Docker image ⚡🚀

---

## 🚀 How to Run Using Prebuilt Platform-Independent Docker Image (Plug & Play ⚡)

This is the easiest way to run LeetFlix without worrying about local setup or building the image.

1️⃣ Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) is installed and running.

2️⃣ Pull the prebuilt image from Docker Hub:  
```bash
docker pull sameercodes/leetflix:latest
```

3️⃣ Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 sameercodes/leetflix:latest
```

👉 If port 5000 is already taken, run on a different port:
```bash
docker run -p 5001:5000 sameercodes/leetflix:latest
```

4️⃣ Open in your browser:


App → http://localhost:5000


Or → http://localhost:5001 if you used port 5001



⚡ That’s it — instant plug-and-play power 🧱💯
