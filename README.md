## 🚀 How to Run Using Prebuilt Platform-Independent Docker Image (Plug & Play ⚡)

This is the easiest way to run LeetFlix without worrying about local setup or building the image.

1️⃣ Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) is installed and running.

2️⃣ Pull the prebuilt image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull sameercodes/leetflix:latest
```

3️⃣ Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 sameercodes/leetflix:latest
```

👉 If port 5000 is already taken, run on a different port:

```bash
docker run -p 5001:5000 sameercodes/leetflix:latest
```

4️⃣ Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you used, like `http://localhost:5001`).

⚡ That’s it — instant plug-and-play power 🧱💯
